# Hangman Game Challenge âœ¨

## Objective
Build a classic Hangman game using Python to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Students will learn to implement game logic and design an engaging interface.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Game Interface
**Description:**  
Design an interface that displays the current game state, including underscores for unrevealed letters and appropriate messages for game outcomes.

**Requirements:**
- Display underscores corresponding to each letter of the hidden word.
- Update the display as correct letters are guessed.
- Show a win message if the word is fully revealed and a lose message when attempts are exhausted.

### Task 2: Implement Game Logic
**Description:**  
Develop the core game logic including random word selection, processing of user input, and tracking remaining attempts.

**Requirements:**
- Randomly select a word from a predefined list.
- Accept letter guesses from the user.
- Track and display the number of remaining attempts and incorrect guesses.
- Terminate the game when the word is guessed or attempts run out.

## Resources
Refer to the starter code provided in the assignment folder. Do not modify file and folder names.
